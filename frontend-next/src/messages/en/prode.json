  "section1Title": "What is a prode?",
  "section1P1": "If you've ever been around Argentines during a football tournament, you've probably heard the word <strong>prode</strong>. At the office, at the stadium, at the weekend barbecue: \"hey, are we setting up a prode for the World Cup?\" is a phrase that gets repeated every time a major tournament kicks off. But the history behind that word runs much deeper than it appears at first glance.",
  "section1P2": "It all started in <strong>1972</strong>, when the Argentine government officially launched the <strong>PRODE (Pronosticos Deportivos — Sports Predictions)</strong>. It was a state-run system where citizens went to their local kiosk, bought a printed card and marked their predictions for the matchday of Argentine football. You marked 1 (home win), X (draw) or 2 (away win) for each game. If you got them all right, you won the accumulated jackpot. That simple, that addictive.",
  "section1P3": "The PRODE quickly became a <strong>massive social phenomenon</strong>. On Friday afternoons, the queues at kiosks were part of the urban landscape of Buenos Aires, Rosario, Cordoba, Mendoza and every city across the country. On Mondays, the first conversation at any office in Argentina started with \"how'd you do in the prode?\". It didn't matter if you were a football fanatic or could barely tell offside from a corner kick — everyone played the prode. It was a collective ritual that crossed social classes, ages and levels of football knowledge.",
  "section1P4": "The official PRODE was discontinued in <strong>1998</strong> after the privatization of the National Lottery, but the word remained <strong>permanently etched in the Argentine vocabulary</strong>. Today, more than 50 years after its creation, when a group of friends organizes predictions for the World Cup, Champions League or the South American qualifiers, they still call it a \"prode\". In other countries they use different words: <strong>quiniela</strong> in Mexico, <strong>polla</strong> in Colombia and Chile, <strong>penca</strong> in Uruguay. But in Argentina, the prode is the prode — and the tradition is immortal.",
  "section2Title": "How does a prode work on Picks4All?",
  "section2Intro": "Setting up your <strong>prode deportivo online</strong> with Picks4All is easier than going to the kiosk to buy a card. You don't need spreadsheets, you don't need volunteers to tally points by hand, and you don't need to chase anyone on WhatsApp for their predictions. The entire process takes three steps:",
  "step1Title": "Create your prode",
  "step1Desc": "Sign up for free on Picks4All (you only need an email), pick the tournament you want — 2026 World Cup, Champions League, Copa America, whatever's available — and give your group a name. Configure the scoring rules (points for exact score, for guessing the winner, for goal difference) and your prode is ready to receive players.",
  "step2Title": "Invite your friends",
  "step2Desc": "When you create your prode, a unique code is generated. Share it via WhatsApp, Instagram, the office group chat, however you want. Your friends sign up, enter the code and they're in the prode. No manual approvals, no waiting — they join instantly.",
  "step3Title": "Predict and compete",
  "step3Desc": "Each participant enters their predictions before every match starts (the deadline is usually 10 minutes before kickoff). When the official result is published, points are calculated automatically and the leaderboard updates instantly. No manual tallying, no arguing about whether a point was correctly entered. The ranking speaks for itself.",
  "stepsOutro": "And the most important part: Picks4All is <strong>completely free</strong>. No real money involved, it's not a gambling site and there are no hidden costs. It's simply the digital version of the prode you've always known — the one you used to set up with a card at the kiosk, and now set up from your phone in two minutes.",
  "section3Title": "Why is Picks4All better than an Excel spreadsheet?",
  "section3P1": "Let's be honest: we all know the story. Someone in the group volunteers as organizer, builds a Google Sheets or Excel spreadsheet with all the matches, sends the link via WhatsApp and says \"enter your predictions before Friday\". The first two matchdays work more or less fine. By the third, half the group hasn't entered anything, the organizer is tired of tallying points, and the spreadsheet sits abandoned in some corner of Google Drive. Organizing a prode by hand is a thankless job that always falls on one person.",
  "section3P2": "Picks4All eliminates all those problems at the root. The <strong>leaderboard updates automatically</strong> after every match, so nobody has to tally points or argue about whether a result was entered correctly. The platform is <strong>mobile-friendly</strong>: it works perfectly on your phone, something anyone who's tried editing an Excel spreadsheet from their phone knows is torture. You can choose between <strong>different scoring rules</strong> — exact score, correct result, home goals, away goals, goal difference — and the system handles all the calculations.",
  "section3P3": "Every prediction is <strong>timestamped and recorded</strong>, results are verifiable, and if the admin needs to correct a score (because of an entry error), the system maintains a complete change history. It's the transparency every prode needs to keep the peace in the group. And best of all: it's <strong>free forever</strong>. No paid plans, no intrusive ads, no fine print.",
  "pullQuote": "\"The PRODE was born in 1972 as a state-run game, but it became something much bigger: a tradition that unites entire generations of Argentines around a shared passion. From the kiosk card to the smartphone, the essence remains the same.\"",
  "closingP1": "The prode has something that no fantasy sports app or prediction house can replicate: the personal factor. You're not competing against strangers or an algorithm — you're competing against your cousin who claims to know more about football than you, against your coworker who always nails the draws, against your best friend who's been at the top of the ranking since last Copa America. That healthy rivalry, the banter after every matchday, the WhatsApp group exploding when Argentina scores a last-minute goal — that's what makes the prode special. And Picks4All preserves all of that intact.",
  "closingP2": "Whether you're setting up your prode for the next derby, for the World Cup 2026 qualifiers in the United States, Mexico and Canada, or for any tournament that excites you, Picks4All gives you the tool to do it simply, quickly and <strong>completely free</strong>. No real money. No draws. Pure entertainment among friends, just like the prode has always been.",
