  "section1Title": "What is a penca?",
  "section1P1": "A <strong>penca</strong> is the Uruguayan word for a football prediction pool — and in Uruguay, it is far more than just a game. It is that competition you set up with friends, at the office, or in the family group chat every time a tournament starts: everyone puts in their prediction for each match, and at the end of the matchday you see who got the most results right. You do not need to be a football coach or understand tactical formations — you just need the courage to say \"Uruguay 2, Brazil 1\" and stand by it until the final whistle.",
  "section1P2": "But the <strong>penca de futbol</strong> in Uruguay is much more than a pastime. It is a tradition born in the only country in the world that can say it hosted and won the <strong>first ever FIFA World Cup</strong>. It was 1930, at the Estadio Centenario in Montevideo, when La Celeste lifted the trophy in front of 93,000 people. Twenty years later, in the legendary <strong>Maracanazo of 1950</strong>, Uruguay stunned the world again by beating Brazil in the World Cup final on Brazilian soil. Those two stars on the national crest are not just history — they are the reason every Uruguayan feels entitled to have an opinion about football and to prove it in a penca.",
  "section1P3": "The penca is present at every level of Uruguayan football. People set up pencas for the <strong>Campeonato Uruguayo</strong> (with the Nacional vs Penarol clasico as the showpiece), for the <strong>Copa America</strong>, for the <strong>South American World Cup Qualifiers</strong>, and of course for the <strong>FIFA World Cup</strong>. When there is football, there is a penca. It is a social ritual that cuts across generations: the grandfather who has been running one on paper for decades, the parents who moved it to an Excel spreadsheet, and the younger generation who now want it on their phone.",
  "section1P4": "In other countries, the same game goes by different names: <strong>quiniela</strong> in Mexico, <strong>polla</strong> in Colombia and Chile, <strong>prode</strong> in Argentina, <strong>porra</strong> in Spain, <strong>bolao</strong> in Brazil. But in Uruguay the word is <strong>penca</strong>, and that is non-negotiable. It comes from the Rio de la Plata tradition and is so deeply embedded in everyday vocabulary that media outlets, sports radio stations, and even companies use it naturally: \"arma tu penca\" (set up your penca), \"la penca del Mundial\" (the World Cup penca), \"vamos con la penca de la fecha\" (let's do the matchday penca).",

  "section3Title": "Why Picks4All for your penca?",
  "section3P1": "For as long as anyone can remember, pencas were done by hand. Someone would print a sheet with the fixtures for the matchday, hand it out at the office or at the Sunday asado (barbecue), and then spend hours adding up points in a spreadsheet. The same problems always came up: someone lost the sheet, someone else miscounted a point, and there was always the clever one who tried to change their prediction after the match had already started.",
  "section3P2": "With Picks4All, all of that is solved without losing the essence. The <strong>leaderboard is calculated automatically</strong> after every match — zero errors, zero arguments. <strong>Predictions lock themselves</strong> before kickoff, so nobody can cheat. You can share your penca <strong>via WhatsApp</strong> with a simple code, and everything works perfectly <strong>from your phone</strong>: enter your predictions on the bus, in the supermarket queue, in the stands, or while sipping mate and watching the pre-match build-up.",
  "section3P3": "And most importantly: <strong>it is free forever</strong>. No money involved, no sweepstakes, nothing to do with real betting. It is pure entertainment among friends, as a penca should be.",
  "pullQuote": "\"In a country of three and a half million that has won two World Cups, the penca is not just a game — it is a way of life. From the Centenario to the Maracana, from the office noticeboard to the WhatsApp group, the Uruguayan penca is more alive than ever.\"",
  "closingP1": "The penca has something that no fantasy sports app or prediction platform can replicate: the personal factor. You are not competing against strangers or algorithms — you are competing against your cousin who claims to know more about football than you, against your coworker who always nails the draws, against your best friend who has been top of the leaderboard since last Copa America. That healthy rivalry, those jokes after every matchday, that WhatsApp group that explodes when Uruguay scores a last-minute goal — that is what makes the penca special. And that is exactly what Picks4All preserves.",
  "closingP2": "Whether you are setting up your penca for the next clasico, for the Qualifiers heading to the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Mexico, and Canada, or for any tournament you are passionate about, Picks4All gives you the tool to do it simply, quickly, and <strong>completely free</strong>. No real money. No sweepstakes. Pure entertainment among friends, as the penca has always been.",
