  "section1Title": "What is a football pool?",
  "section1P1": "A <strong>football pool</strong> is one of the oldest and most beloved social games in the world of sport. The concept is simple: a group of people each predict the outcomes of a set of football matches, and whoever gets the most results right wins. No coaching badges required, no tactical analysis needed — just the confidence to say \"2-1 to the home side\" and the patience to wait ninety minutes for the final whistle.",
  "section1P2": "The origins of the modern football pool trace back to <strong>1923 in England</strong>, when John Moores founded <strong>Littlewoods Pools</strong> in Liverpool. He printed coupons and handed them out to fans outside Old Trafford, asking them to predict the results of upcoming matches. Despite a rocky start — legend has it his first week brought in just four shillings in prize money — the idea caught fire. Within a decade, millions of Britons were filling in their pool coupons every week, making it a national ritual as ingrained as the Saturday afternoon football results read out on television.",
  "section1P3": "The concept proved so compelling that it crossed oceans and borders, adapting to every culture it touched. In <strong>Spain</strong> it became the <strong>quiniela</strong> (official, state-run since 1946) and the <strong>porra</strong> (informal, among friends). In <strong>Mexico</strong> and <strong>Ecuador</strong>, people call it <strong>quiniela</strong>. In <strong>Colombia</strong> and <strong>Chile</strong>, it is a <strong>polla</strong>. <strong>Argentina</strong> had the famous <strong>PRODE</strong> (Pronosticos Deportivos), a government-run system from 1972. <strong>Uruguay</strong> calls it <strong>penca</strong>. In <strong>Brazil</strong>, it is the <strong>bolao</strong>. The name changes, but the essence is universal: predict, compete, and enjoy.",
  "section1P4": "Today, football pools are no longer confined to paper coupons and pub chalkboards. Digital platforms have made it possible to run a pool with friends scattered across different cities or even different countries, all from a phone screen. But the heart of the game remains the same as it was a century ago at Old Trafford: a group of people, a set of matches, and the thrill of seeing who called it right.",

  "section3Title": "Why Picks4All for your football pool?",
  "section3P1": "For a century, football pools were done by hand. Someone printed a sheet with the fixtures, passed it around the office or pinned it to the pub noticeboard, and then spent hours tallying points in a spreadsheet. The same problems always came up: someone lost their sheet, someone else miscounted a point, and there was always the one who tried to change their prediction after kickoff.",
  "section3P2": "With Picks4All, all of that is solved without losing the essence. The <strong>leaderboard is calculated automatically</strong> after every match — zero errors, zero arguments. <strong>Predictions lock themselves</strong> before kickoff, so nobody can cheat. You can share your pool <strong>via WhatsApp</strong> with a simple code, and everything works perfectly <strong>from your phone</strong>: enter your predictions on the bus, in the queue at the shop, in the stands, or while watching the pre-match coverage with a cup of tea.",
  "section3P3": "And most importantly: <strong>it is free forever</strong>. No money involved, no sweepstakes, nothing to do with real betting. It is pure entertainment among friends, as a football pool should be.",
  "pullQuote": "\"From Littlewoods coupons at Old Trafford in 1923 to WhatsApp groups spanning continents today, the football pool is one of sport's great unifiers. Different countries, different names — quiniela, polla, prode, penca, porra, bolao — but always the same game: predict, compete, and enjoy with the people who matter to you.\"",
  "closingP1": "What makes the football pool truly special is that it transcends borders and languages. A group of friends in Liverpool filling in their weekend predictions is doing exactly the same thing as a family in Bogota setting up their \"polla mundialista,\" a group of colleagues in Buenos Aires running their \"prode,\" or mates in Montevideo organizing their \"penca.\" The names may differ — quiniela, polla, prode, penca, porra, bolao, football pool — but the experience is universal: the excitement of making your picks, the tension as the matches play out, and the bragging rights that come with finishing on top.",
  "closingP2": "Whether you are setting up your pool for the Premier League, the Champions League, the World Cup 2026 in the United States, Mexico, and Canada, or any tournament that fires up your passion, Picks4All gives you the tool to do it simply, quickly, and <strong>completely free</strong>.
