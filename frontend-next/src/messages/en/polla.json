  "section1Title": "What is a polla futbolera?",
  "section1P1": "In <strong>Colombia</strong>, <strong>Chile</strong> and <strong>Venezuela</strong>, every time a major football tournament kicks off the same question pops up in offices, WhatsApp groups and family gatherings: \"have you joined the polla yet?\". A <strong>polla futbolera</strong> is a prediction game where each participant forecasts match scores and earns points based on accuracy. At the end of the tournament, whoever has the most points earns the group's bragging rights — and the privilege of reminding everyone about it until the next edition.",
  "section1P2": "You don't need to be a sports analyst or a statistics expert to play. The beauty of the <strong>polla deportiva</strong> is precisely that: the person who never watches football can beat the lifelong fanatic. It's a game of intuition, gut feelings, of \"I just feel the home team wins 2-0 today\". That's what makes it so fun and so addictive.",
  "section1P3": "The word <strong>polla</strong> traces its roots to the <strong>Polla Chilena de Beneficencia</strong>, an institution founded in 1934 that organized collective draws for social causes. Over the decades, the term spread throughout the Andean and Caribbean region until it became the natural way to refer to any prediction game among friends. When the tournament in question is a World Cup, the tradition transforms into the famous <strong>polla mundialista</strong>: a social phenomenon that moves millions of people from Bogota to Valparaiso, from Caracas to Barranquilla.",
  "section1P4": "In other Latin American countries, the same game goes by different names: <strong>quiniela</strong> in Mexico, <strong>penca</strong> in Uruguay and Brazil, <strong>prode</strong> in Argentina, <strong>porra</strong> in Spain. But in Colombia, Chile and Venezuela, the word is <strong>polla</strong> — no discussion. It's part of everyday language: \"the office polla\", \"the World Cup polla\", \"join the polla we set up\". Where there's football, there's a polla.",
  "section2Title": "How does a polla work on Picks4All?",
  "section2Intro": "Organizing a polla futbolera has always been fun, but the logistics were a headache. Someone had to print the match schedule, collect everyone's predictions, tally points by hand and keep the standings up to date. With <strong>Picks4All</strong>, all of that disappears. Here's how it works:",
  "step1Title": "Create your polla in seconds",
  "step1Desc": "Sign up for free with your email and select the tournament you want to play: the 2026 World Cup, Champions League, Copa America or any competition available on the platform. Name your polla, choose the scoring system you prefer and you're done — your polla is live and ready for participants. No fees, no downloads.",
  "step2Title": "Invite your friends with a code",
  "step2Desc": "Picks4All generates a unique invitation code for your polla. Send it via WhatsApp, Telegram, email or wherever you like. Your friends sign up for free, enter the code and they're in. It can be 4 close friends or 60 coworkers — there's no participant limit and everyone joins at no cost.",
  "step3Title": "Predict, compete and enjoy",
  "step3Desc": "Each participant enters their prediction before every match starts. When the game ends, the system calculates points automatically and updates the standings instantly. Everyone can check the leaderboard from their phone at any time. Zero calculation errors, zero dependence on one person to keep the polla running.",
  "stepsOutro": "That's it. No hidden costs, no subscriptions, no fine print. <strong>Picks4All is and will remain free</strong>. The polla futbolera has always been a game among friends, and that's how it should stay.",
  "section3Title": "Why use Picks4All for your polla?",
  "section3P1": "Paper pollas and Excel spreadsheets have a fundamental problem: they depend on the goodwill of someone willing to manage everything. And when that person gets tired, the polla dies. Picks4All eliminates that bottleneck because the platform does the heavy lifting for you. <strong>Automatic leaderboard</strong> after every matchday — points are calculated on their own and the ranking updates in real time. Nobody has to add up scores manually or update spreadsheets.",
  "section3P2": "<strong>Optimized for mobile.</strong> Most people make their predictions from their phone. Picks4All is designed to work perfectly on small screens — you can enter your picks on the bus to work, at the stadium before the match starts, or from your couch at home. <strong>Multiple scoring systems:</strong> not all groups play the same way. On Picks4All, the organizer configures the rules when creating the polla and the system handles the rest.",
  "section3P3": "<strong>Free forever.</strong> Picks4All doesn't charge for creating pollas, has no hidden premium tier and never involves real money under any circumstances. It's a free entertainment platform, designed so the polla futbolera remains what it's always been: a game among friends, no complications, no costs.",
  "pullQuote": "\"The polla futbolera is more than predictions and points — it's that Monday morning conversation at the office, the midnight message when a result saved your week, the friendly rivalry with your best friend who swears they know more about football than you. It's a tradition that unites generations in Colombia, Chile and Venezuela.\"",
  "closingP1": "The polla has something that no fantasy sports app or prediction house can replicate: the personal factor. You're not competing against strangers or an algorithm — you're competing against your cousin who claims to know more about football than you, against your coworker who always nails the draws, against your best friend who's been leading the ranking since last Copa America. That healthy rivalry, the banter after every matchday, the WhatsApp group exploding when your team scores a last-minute goal — that's what makes the polla special.",
  "closingP2": "Whether you're setting up a polla for the next derby, for the World Cup 2026 qualifiers in the United States, Mexico and Canada, or for any tournament that excites you, Picks4All gives you the tool to do it simply, quickly and <strong>completely free</strong>. No real money. No draws. Pure entertainment among friends, just like the polla has always been.",
