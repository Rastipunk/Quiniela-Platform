  "section1Title": "What is a porra deportiva?",
  "section1P1": "If you have Spanish friends or have spent time in Spain, you have probably heard someone say <strong>\"vamos a echar una porra\"</strong> — let's set up a porra. A <strong>porra deportiva</strong> is the Spanish tradition of organizing informal prediction games among friends, coworkers, or family. Everyone puts in their forecast for a set of matches, and at the end of the matchday you see who got the most results right. You do not need to be a football manager — you just need the courage to say \"Spain 2, France 1\" and wait for the final whistle.",
  "section1P2": "The porra has deep roots in Spanish culture, born long before the internet in the <strong>bars and penas deportivas</strong> (supporters' clubs) found in every corner of the country. Members of Real Madrid, Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao, or Betis peñas would gather every weekend to debate football and, naturally, set up the porra for the upcoming fixtures. In many places, participants would throw a symbolic amount into a pot — a few pesetas back then, a couple of euros today — and whoever got the most predictions right took it home. It was social, informal, and fun.",
  "section1P3": "It is important to distinguish the porra from <strong>La Quiniela</strong>, the official state-run game that has existed in Spain since <strong>1946</strong>. La Quiniela is a product of Loterias y Apuestas del Estado (Spain's national lottery authority) where you mark 1 (home), X (draw), or 2 (away) on fifteen La Liga matches and pay for your ticket. The porra, on the other hand, is what you set up <strong>among friends</strong>: no intermediaries, no entry fee (or just a symbolic pot among mates), and with rules you decide yourself. \"Echar una porra\" is as quintessentially Spanish as \"ir de canas\" (going for beers) — everyone knows what it means.",
  "section1P4": "In other Spanish-speaking countries, the same game goes by different names: <strong>quiniela</strong> in Mexico and Ecuador, <strong>polla</strong> in Colombia and Chile, <strong>prode</strong> in Argentina, <strong>penca</strong> in Uruguay. In Spain both terms coexist — La Quiniela as the official game and the porra as the informal tradition among friends. But when someone says \"let's set up a porra for the Champions League,\" everyone knows they are talking about the friendly competition, not the lottery ticket.",

  "section3Title": "Why Picks4All for your porra?",
  "section3P1": "For as long as anyone can remember, porras were done by hand. Someone would print a sheet with the fixtures for the matchday, pass it around the office or pin it to the board at the pena, and then spend hours adding up points in a spreadsheet. The same problems always came up: someone lost the sheet, someone else miscounted a point, and there was always the clever one who tried to change their prediction after the match had started.",
  "section3P2": "With Picks4All, all of that is solved without losing the essence. The <strong>leaderboard is calculated automatically</strong> after every match — zero errors, zero arguments. <strong>Predictions lock themselves</strong> before kickoff, so nobody can cheat. You can share your porra <strong>via WhatsApp</strong> with a simple code, and everything works perfectly <strong>from your phone</strong>: enter your predictions on the train, in the supermarket queue, in the stands, or while having a beer watching the pre-match build-up.",
  "section3P3": "And most importantly: <strong>it is free forever</strong>. No money involved, no sweepstakes, nothing to do with real betting. It is pure entertainment among friends, as a porra should be.",
  "pullQuote": "\"From the peñas deportivas of the 1950s to today's WhatsApp groups, the Spanish porra is more alive than ever. It is not a bet — it is a social tradition that turns every La Liga matchday, every Champions League night, and every World Cup summer into something personal.\"",
  "closingP1": "The porra has something that no betting house or fantasy app can replicate: the personal factor. You are not competing against strangers or algorithms — you are competing against your workmate who claims to know more about football than you, against your brother-in-law who always nails the draws, against your best friend who has been top of the leaderboard since the last Euros. That healthy rivalry, those jokes after every matchday, that WhatsApp group that goes wild when Spain scores a last-minute goal — that is what makes the porra special. And that is exactly what Picks4All preserves.",
  "closingP2": "Whether you are setting up your porra for the next El Clasico, for the Champions League, for the Euros, or for the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Mexico, and Canada, Picks4All gives you the tool to do it simply, quickly, and <strong>completely free</strong>. No real money. No sweepstakes. Pure entertainment among friends, as the porra has always been.",
